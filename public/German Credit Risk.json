        "descriptionNullable": "# Context \nThe original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. The link to the original dataset can be found below.\n\n# Content\nIt is almost impossible to understand the original dataset due to its complicated system of categories and symbols. Thus, I wrote a small Python script to convert it into a readable CSV file. Several columns are simply ignored, because in my opinion either they are not important or their descriptions are obscure. The selected attributes are:\n\n 1. Age (numeric)\n 2. Sex (text: male, female)\n 3. Job (numeric: 0 - unskilled and non-resident, 1 - unskilled and resident, 2 - skilled, 3 - highly skilled)\n 4. Housing (text: own, rent, or free)\n 5. Saving accounts (text - little, moderate, quite rich, rich)\n 6. Checking account (numeric, in DM - Deutsch Mark)\n 7. Credit amount (numeric, in DM)\n 8. Duration (numeric, in month)\n 9. Purpose (text: car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation/others)\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nSource: [UCI][1]\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29",
